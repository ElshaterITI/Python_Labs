
#     Python Practice Tasks
#     =====================

#     Rules:
#         - Everything must be written inside functions.
#         - The file should run as a script.
#         - When the script starts, the user must see a menu of numbered scenarios  (1: List order, 2: Pepole with favorite color , .....).
#         - The user chooses a number, and the program runs the corresponding function.
#         - Each task should only run when chosen from the menu.
#         - At ANY stage: if the user enters invalid input, the program must:
#               * Show an error message
#               * Display what valid input looks like
#               * Let the user try again (do not crash or exit)

# Tasks:
# ------

# 1 - Ask the user to enter 5 numbers.
#     Store them, then display them in ascending order and descending order.

# 2 - Write a function that takes two numbers: (length, start).

#     starting from the given start number and increasing by one each time.
#     Print the result.

#     When finished, print:
#         * The total of all numbers entered
#         * The count of valid entries
#         * The average
#     If the user enters something invalid, show an error and continue.
